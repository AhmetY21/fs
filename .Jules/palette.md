**Learning:** Visual-only severity indicators (dots) in Feng Shui report were completely invisible to screen readers, hiding critical information.
**Action:** Always wrap visual rating/status indicators with `role="img"` and provide descriptive `aria-label` translating the visual count to meaningful text (e.g., "Critical (5/5)").

**Learning:** Using `window.alert` for file validation disrupts the user flow and is inaccessible to some screen readers.
**Action:** Use inline, conditional rendering for error messages with `role="alert"` to provide immediate, accessible feedback without blocking the UI.

## 2025-02-14 - [Accessible Spatial Maps]
**Learning:** Canvas-based spatial visualizations are completely inaccessible to screen readers without descriptive fallback content.
