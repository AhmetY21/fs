**Learning:** Next.js `next/font` provides a significant performance boost by self-hosting Google Fonts and handling loading strategies automatically. It replaces the need for manual `<link>` tags and CSS `@import`.
**Action:** Always prefer `next/font` over external font services in Next.js projects. Ensure global CSS variables are updated to use the variables provided by the font loader.
